# DA14585/DA14586/DA14531 Peripheral BLE- Measuring temperature using MCP9808 or DA14531 internal sensor 

---


## Example description

This example shows:
- How to use I2C to read MCP9808 temperature register.
- How to use I2C to write MCP9808 resolution register.
- How to measure the temperature using DA14531 internal temperature sensor.
	- __The internal temperature sensor is not available for the DA14585 and DA14586.__

The functionality can be verified by:
- BLE notifications.

## HW and SW configuration
This example runs on the BLE Smart SoC (System on Chip) devices:
- DA14585/DA14586 or DA14531 daughter board + DA145xxDEVKT-P PRO-Motherboard.
- DA14585/DA14586 daughter board + Basic development Kit mother board.

The user manuals for the development kits can be found:
- [here](https://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/products/da14531-development-kit-pro) for the DA145xxDEVKT-P PRO-Motherboard.
- [here](https://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/sites/default/files/um-b-048_da14585da14586_getting_started_guide_v2.0_0.pdf) for the Basic Development Kit.

* __Software configuration__
This example requires:
	- [SDK6.0.12](https://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/da14531_sdk_latest).
	- Keil5.
	- __SEGGER’s J-Link__ tools should be downloaded and installed..

## How to measure temperature using the DA14531 internal Sensor
	-Select the build for DA14531.
	-Uncomment the CFG_USE_INTERNAL_TEMP_SENSOR definition (found in da1458x_config_basic.h) to acquire temperature via the internal temperature sensor. See line 205 in the image shown below.

## How to run the example
### Setup
Before launching the Keil project, make sure to link the SDK and project environment using the Python linker script `dlg_make_keil_vx.xxx`. More information [here](https://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/sites/default/files/sw-example-da145x-example-setup.pdf).
1. Start Keil using the `ble_temperature_ntf.uvprojx` Keil project file.

2. Expand the dialog shown in the red box in the image below.

3. Select your device: DA14531, DA14586 or DA14585.

4. Compile (F7) and launch (ctrl + F5) the example.\
If the warning (shown below) pops up press OK.

## Expected Results

1. Open the BLE scanner app and look for "DLG-TEMP".

2. Connect to the device.

3. Subscribe to the notifications.

If everything went well, you should be able to receive temperature data as the value of the custom characteristic, as shown in the image below.

__Note that the DA14531 internal temperature sensor uses int8_t instead of the double temperature value shown below__

## How it works

Tutorial 3 on the [Dialog Semiconductor support](https://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/sites/default/files/training_03_custom_profile_gatt_cmd_example_v1.2.pdf) website shows how to make your own custom profile. The **user_catch_rest_hndl** function in user_peripheral.c will handle the messages for our custom profile. This application only has one possible 
custom action: a write to the notification. When this occurs the **user_temperature_message_handler** function is called. This function will check the contents of the write. If the content of the write equals zero, the temperature timer is canceled. If the value is 
anything else, a timer is generated that calls **user_send_temperature_ntf** after NOTIFICATION_DELAY ms. **user_send_temperature_ntf** will read out the sensor data and convert it to a string(for demo purposes). The string will be placed in a message, along with some other parameters, like the connection ID
and the characteristic handle. After the message is sent, the app_easy_timer function is used to schedule the next call to the **user_send_temperature_ntf** function. This will ensure the temperature is transmitted regularly. The app_easy_timer function
has a resolution of 10ms hence we divide the desired delay in ms by 10.

## Troubleshooting
- Please check that the steps according to your daughter board (DA14531, DA14585 or DA14586) and mother board (basic development kit or DA145xxDEVKT-P PRO-Motherboard) are followed correctly.

- Try a different USB1 cable.

- Try different jumper wires, if used.

- Note that the internal temperature sensor only works for the DA14531

- If none of the above helps, please check the user manual according to your daughter board and mother board. User manual can be found [here](https://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/products/da14531-development-kit-pro) for the DA145xxDEVKT-P PRO-Motherboard and [here](https://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/sites/default/files/um-b-048_da14585da14586_getting_started_guide_v2.0_0.pdf) for the Basic Development Kit
